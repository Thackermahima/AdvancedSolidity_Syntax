1.Mapping 
1.1 memory vs storage - 2 Solidity storage locations

Uint -> Fixed variables
String -> Dynamic variables - it goes to memory Ram or heap
- As like above address is fixed so it's store in the storage where we don't need to specify memory 
and string is dynamic so we need to store it in memory  
- If variable is declared as a global then we don't need to specify memory keyword so for ex string name;
it will stay forever to the contract whereas in functions (string memory happy) it will only store in functions.
it goes to the  ram whereas global variables goes to the hard disk.

               Inheritance is the that one contract can inheritance all the attributes(Object)and Method
               (functions) in any other contracts. 
               In solidity, we perform inheritance using this keyword.
               1) Solidity supports multiple inheritance so your contract can inherit more than one contracts
               2) A child contract can OVERRIDE a parent contract's function uing the OVERRIDE KEYWORD.
               3) Only marked as a virtual can be overidden by the function so other functions
               CANNOT  be overidden by the child contracts.
               4) ORDER OF INHERITANCE MATTERS.
